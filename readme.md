# YetAnotherProjectWithoutName


i (thomas) have obviously a clear preference ðŸ˜„ :


![cordyna](image.png)

- all tld domains still available
- -> easy to find when your google
- "dyna do x" -> fine cli command
- memorizable like a girl's name
- "coordination" / "core" + "dynamic"
- brandable / unique
- multi-purpose: non-data and non-product limited (can also be used as company name for general contracting, plus binding in adjacent ppl's projects like e.g. marketing-alex)


## How Run?
- (get a mac)
- get warp
- get orbstack
- clone repo
- docker-compose up
- (yet to come:) xxx run task-3
- you should see task-server-b, which hosts task-3 to ask cerebro to run it.
- this should trigger cerebro to run the upstream dependencies in correct order. Those taskss partially being managed by a different server (task-server-a).


## Mission Plan:
create a clear distinction for test cases:

- cerebro server
- task server a (with independent workloads)
- task server b (with dependent workloads on server-a)


continuously test:
- graphbuilding capabilities of cerebro
- sends invocation-commands (events) in correct order to correct task-servers
- upon failure, still invokes anything that's not blocked by the failure
- cerebro waits for servers to report back on task states in various intervals
    - upon invocation command: 10 sec for "acknowledged" / "task-started"
    - upon "acknowledged": 10 min for "task-started"
    - upon "task-started": 30 min for "task-completed"



## Vocab/Lingo
- state updates vs commands (both via events)
- task state vs server state ("hey i'm up and have these tasks with these props" VS "hey i'm now running {This}")

- *TASK*: COMMAND["run"] vs COMMAND["invoke"]:

     cerebro '*invokes*': it sends an event that tells a task-server to '*run*' a task

- TASK_STATE["pending"]: cerebro has built the graph and is wating for upstream tasks to complete, before sending out a command to execute this particular task 
- TASK_STATE["queued"]: a task-server has received a run-command from cerebro to run a task, but it's currently busy with somehting else / has not yet actually started running the task
- TASK_STATE["started"]: a task-server has received a run-command from cerebro to run a task, and has now started running it
- TASK_STATE["completed"]: a task-server has received a run-command from cerebro to run a task, has already reported that it has TASK_STATE["started"], and now reports TASK_STATE["completed"] after having finished the task
TASK_STATE["error"]: there was either an error while actually processing the task OR cerebro created this event because no acknowledgement (queued/started) was given by the server within 10 sec. In the first case, the task-server's team is responsible for providing a proper description into the event

## what my goals are now (thomas)
- split the servers and make it clear who comms w/ whom
- make the task-servers declare themselvers to cerebro
- make it easy to cronjob a task while declaring it (e.g. 60 sec for test)
- make it possible to ad-hoc invoke a task from outside via event
- make it better observable what exactly happens in what server and when / in what order
- split the core tooling library from the actual task-specific stuff
- split the core tooling library from cerebro
- properly package the core tooling library
- (take it to the cloud once the test cases work)
- minimise the common dependencies in req.txt, just install ***insert-cool-name*** (ours)
- found a github organization under which we can create proper repos & access rights
- setup a minimal continuous cloud project + CI / CD
